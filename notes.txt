(SumyBooks Royal Blue Card)
1. How I practiced
I practiced creating a CSS card by designing the SumyBooks profile card 
with a royal blue background.
I used HTML for the structure and CSS for styling such as background colors, border radius, padding, 
margin, box-shadow, and text alignment.
I applied flexbox to center elements and used responsive units to make the card look balanced on different screen sizes. 
I also practiced linking external CSS (css/style.css) to the HTML file and styling buttons, images, 
and typography to achieve a modern Canva-like design.
2. Challenges I faced
The main challenge I faced is still needing more explanation on the design structure and layout arrangement. 
Understanding how to properly align elements, manage spacing, and choose the correct CSS properties for positioning was difficult. 
I also found it challenging to combine colors, font sizes, and responsiveness to match a professional design. 
I need more practice and guidance on CSS layout techniques like flexbox, positioning, and responsive design.
3. What I understand better
What I now understand better is that the concept of a CSS card is about mastering CSS styling. 
It focuses on using CSS properties to control layout, colors, spacing, fonts, shadows, and responsiveness.
Through this task, I learned that CSS style mastery helps in creating clean, attractive, and professional web components 
like profile cards and product cards for websites such as Sumys Varieties Online Store.
